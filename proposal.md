## Hypothesis

Is a person's social standards correlated with a person's expected salary?

## Overview

The goal of this study is to determine whether a person's social standards are correlated with a person's expected salary. The idea behind the hypothesis is that people who have higher social standards expect a higher salary. The opposite can also be argued - does a person's expected salary determine a person's social standards? This study does not aim to determine which variables are explanatory or a response, but rather to determine whether a strong correlation exists between social standards and expected salary.

## Survey

The hypothesis test requires data collection. A survey is the best practical way of collecting the required data for this study. The questions for the study needs to be well formulated to ensure that the correct data is collected to reach a conclusion. The questions for this survey will contribute to determining either a person's social standards or expected salary. To avoid response bias the survey questions should not reveal what the hypothesis is that is being tested.

The following questions will be included in the survey. A brief motivation is given for each question or subset of questions.

**What should someone with your qualifications and experience expect to receive as an average monthly salary?**

> Numerical
>
> This question aims to set a baseline salary for the person answering the questionnaire. The survey needs to determine whether a person expects to earn more than the average person with similar credentials. Determining the average expected salary, creates a control or baseline observation that can be used as comparison to a person's personal expectations.

**Would you keep a job that does not give you a salary increase over the next two years? Assume high job satisfaction.**

> Binary
>
> The response to this question should give an indication whether a person strives for a higher income. Adding the assumption of high job satisfaction, places emphasis on the importance of the person's expected salary.

**What is the monthly salary that you aim to receive 1 year from now?**

> Numerical
>
> This question tries to quantify a person's subjective expected salary. Generally, a person would not receive a significantly higher salary in a year's time, except if the person expects to be in a better paying job role. If the baseline salary is adjusted with an annual inflation increase, it can be compared to the person's expected salary a year from now. Asking the question in this way, attempts to avoid the person realizing what the study is about, while still gaining valuable information.

**What is your country of employment/future employment?**

> Categorical
>
> The country a person works in, plays a big role in a person's expected salary. Different countries have different costs of living which influences the general salary of a person with a specific job role. A country's GDP or living cost can be used to normalize the salary-related responses.
