# Proposal

## Hypothesis

<h5 align="center"> Is a person's social standards correlated with a person's expected salary? </a></h5>

## Overview

The goal of this study is to determine whether a person's social standards are correlated with a person's expected salary. The idea behind the hypothesis is that people who have higher social standards expect a higher salary. The opposite can also be argued - does a person's expected salary determine a person's social standards? This study does not aim to determine which variables are explanatory or a response, but rather to determine whether a strong correlation exists between social standards and expected salary.

## Methodology

The test statistic will be attempting to identify if there is a strong correlation between social standards and a person's salary expectations. The t-test will aid in determining statistical significance between the explanatory and response variables. A positive correlation would be expected between the continuous numerical measurement of social standards and the normalized continuous expected salary range. Social standards and expected salaries are expected to both form t-distributions given the survey responses. A linear regression model seems to be an appropriate choice for the study, since our response variable (expected salary) is a continuous range and the explanatory variables related to social standards are expected to have a linear relationship with expected salary.

## Survey

The hypothesis test requires data collection. A survey is the best practical way of collecting the required data for this study. The questions for the study needs to be well formulated to ensure that the correct data is collected to reach a conclusion. The questions for this survey will contribute to determining either a person's social standards or expected salary. To avoid response bias the survey questions should not reveal what the hypothesis is that is being tested.

The following questions will be included in the survey. They are defined below in two sections with a brief motivation for each question or subset of questions.

### Financially-driven Questions

**What should someone with your qualifications and experience expect to receive as an average monthly salary?**

> Numerical
>
> This question aims to set a baseline salary for the person answering the questionnaire. The survey needs to determine whether a person expects to earn more than the average person with similar credentials. Determining the average expected salary, creates a control or baseline observation that can be used as comparison to a person's personal expectations.

**Would you keep a job that does not give you a salary increase over the next two years? Assuming high job satisfaction.**

> Binary
>
> The response to this question should give an indication whether a person strives for a higher income or not. Adding the assumption of high job satisfaction, places emphasis on the importance of the person's expected salary.

**What is the monthly salary that you aim to receive 1 year from now?**

> Numerical
>
> This question tries to quantify a person's subjective expected salary. Generally, a person would not receive a significantly higher salary in a year's time, except if the person expects to be in a better paying job role. If the baseline salary is adjusted with an annual inflation increase, it can be compared to the person's expected salary a year from now. Asking the question in this way, attempts to avoid the person realizing what the study is about, while still gaining valuable information.

**What is your country of employment/future employment?**

> Categorical
>
> The country a person works in, plays a big role in a person's expected salary. Different countries have different costs of living which influences the general salary of a person with a specific job role. A country's GDP or living cost can be used to normalize the salary-related responses.

### Evaluating Social Standards

The goal will be to evaluate ones need to satisfy certain levels of social needs. A person's standards are most often linked to the standards of the people that surround them, so the following questions aim to identify where the respondent fits in terms of financial comfort.

**How many times a week do you eat out?**

> Standard multiple choice
>
> Typically people who are not as concern about budget will tend to eat out more frequently.  

**How many times a year do your go on a vacation and stay in a hotel?**

> Standard multiple choice
>
> Vacations are an indication of leisure time and financial comfort.

**On a scale of 0 to 10 how would you rate your financial circumstances compared to the population? 0 being "I do not know where my next meal will come from" and 10 being "I am the 1%".**

> Standard multiple choice
>
> This question adds a realtive measurement of where the respondent considers their financial status in comparison to their interpretation of population. It is well known that people typically undervalue themselves, but we are moreso interested in their answer in relation to their previous responses.

**What level of education do you have?**

> Standard multiple choice
>
> The options will be such that beyond undergraduate level is categorised together as to prevent quasi-identifiers of PHD level respondents.

**At which intervals do you purchase a new cellular smart phone?**

> Standard multiple choice
>
> A potential indication of material consumption can be derived from questions regarding shopping for clothing or technology amongst other things. This is an example that could give us an idea of a person's interest in fronting the money to update their possesions more often than average.

## Ethical Considerations

It is likely in the interest of us as investigators and the respondents as subjects to use UBC's Qualtrics tool to ensure our full compliance with FIPPA. Furthermore, we will need to consider the use of a click-through cover letter outlining the survey, the fact that it is voluntary, and that, by continuing, the respondent agrees to the risks and benefits and limits to confidentiality. We will be collecting personally identifiable information like country of origin which is a tricky one considering that there are 2 identifying countries in our class if every classmate is answering. For this, we are assuming that students will not be 100% forced to answer and will further mitigate the issue as we will promote our surveys on social media leveraging each of our exposures to people of different nationalities.
