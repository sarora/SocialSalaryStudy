# Confounding

In general, the observational study strategy includes:
1. To the extent possible, recording potential confounding
variables as part of the data collection process.
2. Using these potential confounding variables as part of the data
analysis.
3. Tempering the causal strength of claims, in light of the
inherent challenges in 1 and 2.




# Social study

## Extraneous variables

We have subjects from all walks of life and are particularly interested in their attitude towards finances and careers.

There could be many factors influencing a participants interest in pursuing a salary increase that could be correlated with the time since the last increase in salary for instance. The question was designed to ask whether a user

Self-reporting is innacurate. The study was designed acknowledging that there could be a certain amount of bias in each person's answers knowing that they may not not have had access to their financial information on hand when responding. Since we are mainly interested in one's relative relatioship between the different monetary values (hence the ratio and the percentages),
we are making the assumption that one's biased impression of their finances can still  be representive of their beliefs when indicating whether money is the main driver in their career.

That being said, this study has its limitations and could have been improved namely in the categorization of expense categories. It can be difficult to differentiate between the different types of conspicuous spending, and one could consider that living expenses includes the over-priced rent for instance. We would have had to use a benchmark of the average costs which would have made us much more reliant and the actual monetary values that were input, or if we maintain the path we chose of only being reliant on the perceived attitude toward one's finances, we would have had to be more explicit in how we differentiate frivolous spending over basic needs.
