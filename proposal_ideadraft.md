### DSCI 554 Proposal for Group Project

## Hypothesis

Are people from different backgrounds driven by different things.

# Question Blocks
Influencers will be blocked into categories such as:
- Age
- nationality
- financial backgrounds
- level of education

# Model

multinomial regression

### Tasks:
rubric={mechanics:1}

- create repo in [ubc-mds-2017](https://github.ubc.ca/ubc-mds-2017). **You must add the TAs as contributors with read access so they can access your work**
- tag release (v1.0)
- submit last commit message in this lab's `README.md` file


### Overall Project Goal:

 You will write up a brief, 3-5 page report (including figures and references) presenting your:
- question
- methods
  - survey study design
  - data collection methods
  - analysis methods
- results and analysis
- discussion of the results
- discussion of your survey/study design

You are expected to follow all the good Data Science workflow practices you have learned thus far in the MDS program. And as such, we expect that your project will:
- be well documented
- be reproducible
- have few bugs (write tests for any functions you write for your analysis code)
- have a Software License and Creative Commons License that describes how you will permit others to use your work
- have a code of conduct document
- have a contributions document
- have a Git history that demonstrates the proposed workflow in the contributions document was followed and that all group members contributed equally

### Specific expectations for this proposal are:
rubric={reasoning:10,writing:2}

> 1. **Read [UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys](https://ethics.research.ubc.ca/sites/ore.ubc.ca/files/documents/Online_Survey-GN.pdf)**

> 2. Identify the question that your team in interested in answering with the survey. The aim of the survey should be to try to answer one specific and testable question. Examples of specific and testable questions include (you can use one of these if you really like them):
  - Does the first programming language someone learns influence whether they prefer R or Python (or have no preference)?
  - Does a person's self-assessment of their knowledge of Git influence their Git tool of choice (e.g., command line, Github website, Git Kraken, Sourcetree, other)?
  - Does laptop operating system influence a person's self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program in the first block of the program?

> 3. Identify the other questions you plan to ask in your survey to identify confounding variables and justify/explain why you plan to include them.

> 4. Describe how you plan to analyze the survey results (e.g., what statistical test(s) do you plan to employ?).

> 5. Discuss the aspects of the [UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys](https://ethics.research.ubc.ca/sites/ore.ubc.ca/files/documents/Online_Survey-GN.pdf) that are relevant to your proposed survey.

# What do students look for when applying for jobs?

* Cultural/demographics
 + financial
 + race
 +
* Customer background
* Previous experience
  +

Dynamic questionaire
Depending on the initial answers it will provide a subset of questions.   

Ask David's network to answer the survey.


Confounding variables, latent variables.


## Expected results

1. People from different cultural backgrounds may have more residency inclined reasons to find a job.

## Concerns

* Finding a platform that limits the amount of responses per person to one.
* Make the study robust to subjective sentiments.

Baseline questions

- Are you currently employed



# IDEA SHIFT
- Is success defined by money? Does money define success?

Same feature space as above with binary outcome either financial gain is ranked 1st or not in terms of vocational priorities.

# Expectations

Depending on your nationality, family socio-economic status, age/generation,

## Feature Categories

One of our questions will be asking them to rank their priorities when looking for a job. The answers will be aggregated into either "Financially-driven" or "Other" and the features will ask questions that pertain to various quantifiers of a person's upbringing.

Top five pieces of information job seekers want employers to provide as they research where to work: 1) Salary/compensation, 2) Benefits, 3) Basic company information, 4) What makes it an attractive place to work, 5) Company mission, vision, values.

### Nationality

### Socio-economic

Rank yourself in society?

How often do you eat out?

Have you ever flown in a plane?

Welfare?

Can you or your family afford tertiary education?
Yes. Yes, with loan. No.

# Ethics

Salary brackets rather than continuous .

Country of origin is a tricky one considering that there are 2 identifying countries in our class if every classmate is answering. For this we are assuming that students will not be 100% forced to answer and will further mitigate the issue we will promote our surveys on social media leveraging each of our exposures to people of different nationalities.
